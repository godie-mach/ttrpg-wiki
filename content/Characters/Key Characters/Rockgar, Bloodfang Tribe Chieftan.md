Large tattoed [orc](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16972-orc) and current chief of the [[Bloodfang clan]]. His mother was a [giant](https://officialbestiary.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_(D%26D) and dad was [[Gurk Bloodfang, Bloodfang Heir]]. Xerov, the white dragon, killed Gurk. Bloodfang did not accept Rockhard as their new leader. After Gurk's death, [[Gorok Bloodfang]] became temporary clan leader and, technically, usurper. He is Rockhard's uncle. Now, Rockhard has killed the dragon (with our help) and by tradition, has killed Gorok to take over as Tribe King.
